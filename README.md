# Reading Timer Web (Frontend)
A web application version of my Reading Timer project, originally written
entirely in Java with a visual GUI using the Java Swing library. In this project
the backend is still written in Java, utilizing the Spring framework to create a Rest API for
this frontend, which written using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, utilizing the React and React Bootstrap libraries.


## Original Description:

### Reading Time Tracker

**Features:**
- Store a text's name, associated genre, and
  word count (provided by the user)
- Track multiple texts at the same time
- In-app timer
- Calculation of *estimated* reading speed using logged time
- ~~Calculation of *estimated* reading time for given word count and genre, using
  the calculated reading speed from other texts~~ (not implemented in this version yet)
- ~~Options to manually adjust logged time~~ (not implemented in this version yet)

**Potential Users:**

- People interested in improving reading speed
- People interested in estimating time needed to complete
  reading a given text
- People interested in tracking how much time they spend reading

**Why:**

* Reading/writing is one of my hobbies, and something that I wish
  I had when reading was a way to keep track of how long it took me to finish
  a particular book or other text, and how this time frame could vary depending on the genre.
  Additionally, I could see this being useful to estimate the time that should be alloted
  to reading a specific text.
